\chapter{Background}
The idea of a pentesting tool used to test SSO implementations such as OAuth, OIDC and SAML was previously discussed by my colleagues Stefano Facchini \cite{stefano_faccini}, Claudio Grisenti \cite{claudio_grisenti} and Wendy Barreto \cite{wendy_barreto}, which developed a plugin in Burp with the intent of automating the the testing of OIDC and OAuth protocols.

\section{Burp Suite}
Burp is one of the most used application security testing software for web security testing. It works by the use of a proxy server over which a browser redirect the traffic to. Burp has access to the proxy, it can sniff HTTP packets and can edit them. Burp also gives the possibility of creating custom plugins giving to the developers access to the java API.
