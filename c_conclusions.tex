\label{chap:Conclusions}
The objectives fixed at the start of this thesis can be considered reached, the new tool and language is fully working as can be seen in \cite{sofia_zanrosso}, still, it is not perfect in terms of stability and affidability, as a deep testing phase should be accomplished, but overall, the tool is functioning well.

As future works, the problems and the limitations seen in \ref{sec:limitations} should be solved. Then, the concept of a test definition language could be extended even for other uses, like for low-level networking protocols such as routing protocols, electronic trading protocols, IP protocols, and so on. Making it possible to search for known vulnerabilities in real-time or just by analyzing saved packets files. For example, a plugin for Wireshark software could be developed.
