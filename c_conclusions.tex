\chapter{Conclusions, Limitations and Future Works}
One of the biggest limitations that the tool has is the session track actions automations, it often happens that some captcha are encountered during execution, making impossible to proceed. Moreover, the track execution is limited, there is only a possible flow of actions (the one defined) and there is not the possibility of inserting if then else constructs that could help to differentiate the actions based on the actual page or popup. For example, it could happen that an "limited time offer" popup could appear in a website only in a particular time, the execution of the session track could be compromised by that, making impossible to distinguish wether the test failed because of the tested vulnerability or the actual popup.
