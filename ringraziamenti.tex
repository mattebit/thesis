%Thanks to Alice, for the help and support during the long exam sessions and the writing of this thesis.
%Thanks to all the E-Agle TRT racing team, for the amazing experience, for the infinite amount of knowledge that it gave to me, for the fun and emotions of building a car from scratch and seeing it racing, and for the lateness in my graduation.
