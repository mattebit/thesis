This thesis covers the work started in my internship at Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK) in the context of Single-Sign-On (\gls{SSO}) protocols testing. SSO protocols are becoming more and more popular these days, and are being used in very sensitive applications such as SPID (Sistema Pubblico di Identità Digitale) an Italian identity management system, or CIE (Carta di Identità Elettronica) whcih is a digital ID card. Considering the vast number of different implementations that are being used from whatever type of service, there is the need to test them in order to ensure that (at least) the most common known vulnerabilities are avoided.\\
To avoid having to manually test each implementation, an automatic tool is necessary. Moreover, a standard language to define these tests has to be defined.
This is what will be shown in this thesis.
