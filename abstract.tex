This thesis covers the work started in my internship at FBK in the context of Single-Sign-On (SSO) protocols testing.
SSO protocols are becoming more and more poular these days, and are being used in very sensitive applications such as SPID or CIE. Seeing the vast number of different implementations that are being used from whatever type of service, there is the need to test them in order to ensure that (at least) the known most common vulnerabilities are avoided.\\ 
To avoid having to manually test each implementation, an automaic tool is necessary. Moreover, a standard language to define these test suites has to be defined.
This is what will be shown in this paper.
