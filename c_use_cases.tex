\label{chap:Use_cases}
In this chapter, some examples of use cases in which the work of this thesis has been used will be shown.

\section{SAML Use-Case}
During the last stages of the development and testing of the tool, a strict collaboration between my colleague Sofia Zanrosso and me has started. Her objective was to create a \gls{SAML} Test Suite to facilitate automatic penetration testing over \gls{SAML}\cite{sofia_zanrosso}. The tool defined in this thesis was compared with other ones and was used to define and execute the tests. During the progress of both our works, a lot of feedback and bugs have been reported to me, speeding up the testing phase of the tool. At the same time, we found that my tool was in some respects better compared to the other alternatives. For example:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Other plugins were giving false positives on some tests
    \item "the previously employed transition times between tools have been greatly reduced"
    \item "making it possible to analyze almost completely the vulnerabilities of the tested subjects"
\end{itemize}

\section{OAuth \& OIDC Use-Case}    
The \gls{OAuth} and \gls{OIDC} tests defined and used in \cite{claudio_grisenti,wendy_barreto} has been re-defined in the language and has been used, during development, to evaluate the correctness of the tool with respect to the already existing ones. The tests written in SBTL language and the other had the same results. Due to the newly available functionalities introduced with SBTL, new tests have been specified, especially active ones.
At the end of the development, a Test Suite written in SBTL for OAuth and OIDC has been defined.
