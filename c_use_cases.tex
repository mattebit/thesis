\chapter{Uses cases}
In this chapter some examples of use cases in which the work of this thesis has been used will be shown.

\section{SAML Use-Case}
During the last stages of the development and testing of the tool, a strict collaboration between my colleague Sofia Zanrosso and me has started. Her objective was to create a SAML testsuite in order to facilitate automatic pentesting over SAML \cite{sofia_zanrosso}. My tool was compared with other ones and was used to define and execute the tests. During the progress of both our works, a lot of feedbacks and bugs has been reported to me, speeding up the testing phase of the tool. At the same time, She found that my tool was by some aspect better w.r.t. other ones that She was using. For example:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Other plugins were giving false positives on multiple tests, while mine was not
    \item "the previously employed transition times between tools have been greatly reduced"
    \item "making it possible to analyze almost completely the vulnerabilities of the tested subjects"
\end{itemize}


\section{OAuth \& OIDC Use-Case}
The \Gls{OAuth} and \Gls{OIDC} tests defined and used in \cite{claudio_grisenti,wendy_barreto} has been re-defined in the STL language and has been tested on some implementations of the protocols.
